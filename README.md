# Infection spread simulation

The Virus Spread Simulation project is a Java-based application designed to model and visualize the spread of a virus within a population. This project leverages computational modeling to simulate various factors influencing virus transmission, providing valuable insights into how diseases propagate and the impact of different intervention strategies.
